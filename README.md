# Neural networks with python
Hey there!
- I'll be posting all my work related to new algorithms I have learnt related to neural networks.
- The codes here are build from scratch i.e. only using numpy unless mentioned otherwise
- Currently the repository has the following:
    - Generic multilayer perceptron network which can be used to create networks with m layers and n hidden units
    - Hybrid learning with simple competitive learning and MLP model
    - Tensorflow test cases for MLP comparision
    - k-means clustering algorithm
    - testing the current codes with data sets
    - Basic housing price prediction
- Future plans:
    - perfect interface for MLP
    - convnet vs hybrid net with RBF
    - Reinforcement learning with FNN and RNN
    - LSTM and GRU's in RNNS
    - Test CapsuleNet
    - Spiking neuron model applied to DNN and RNN
    - MLP with PSO instead of BackPropagation to optimize weights.
    - Adam optimiser for gradient descent on MLP
