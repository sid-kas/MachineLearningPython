# Neural networks research
Hey!
- You are at the right place if you are looking forward to learn or rearch advanced techniques in neural networks.
- I'll be posting all my work related to new algorithms i have learnt related to neural networks.
- Currently the repository has the following:
    - generic multilayer perceptron network which can be used to create networks with m layers and n hidden units
    - Hybrid learning with simple competitive learning and MLP model
    - Tensorflow test cases for MLP comparision
- Future plans:
    - Adam optimiser
    - cure and k-means clustering algorithms
    - convnet vs hybrid net with RBF
